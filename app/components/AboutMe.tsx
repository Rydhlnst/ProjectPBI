            Hi! I&apos;m Riyan, a passionate and curious web developer who loves combining creativity and logic
            to build impactful digital experiences. My journey started in 2020 and has been fueled by a deep
            interest in technology and continuous learning.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I specialize in full-stack development using technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and MongoDB.
            I&apos;m also expanding my expertise into AI and Web3, with a growing portfolio that includes
            AI-integrated apps, decentralized tools, and collaborative platforms.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Beyond just coding, I&apos;m driven by the idea of solving real-world problems. Whether it&apos;s through building smarter
            learning platforms, financial tools, or community-powered applications, I aim to create products
            that empower people and make technology more accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy experimenting with animation tools like GSAP and Rive, exploring new ideas,
            and contributing to innovation challenges globally. I believe in learning by doing, and Iâ€™m always
            open to collaboration and new challenges.
